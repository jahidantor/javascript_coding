Global Variable:

A global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function or block in a program.
Global variables are accessible and can be used throughout the entire program, including inside functions or blocks.
They have a global scope, meaning they can be accessed from any part of the program.
Global variables are typically declared at the top of a program or in a separate configuration file.
Local Variable:

A local variable is a variable that is declared within a function or block in a program.
Local variables are only accessible within the function or block in which they are declared.
They have a local scope, meaning they are limited to the function or block where they are defined.
Local variables are created when the function or block is executed and are destroyed once the function or block completes execution.
